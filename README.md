# Desktop-Assistant
This is an Python program that works using voice command. You can open any local file, any website that you use frequently or even send mails.

Note :- This program works accoding to my settings and locations. For eg- You need to open a website on your browser then you need to provide the browser location. If you need to add some different websites then you can add them in the code itself.

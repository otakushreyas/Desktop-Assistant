# Desktop-Assistant
This is an Python program that works using voice command. You can open any local file, any website that you use frequently or even send mails.

Note :- This program works accoding to my settings and locations. For eg- You need to open a website on your browser then you need to provide the browser location. If you want to add some different websites or change some of the present ones then you can add them in the code itself.
